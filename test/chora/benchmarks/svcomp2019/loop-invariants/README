Unfortunately, the file names do not match those from the article
because the CI checks of the repository require a very specific naming
where properties are encoded into the file name.
The following table relates the file names from the paper to those in this repository:

bin-suffix-5.c | bin-suffix-5_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
const.c        | const_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
eq1.c          | eq1_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
eq2.c          | eq2_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
even.c         | even_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
mod4.c         | mod4_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
odd.c          | odd_true-unreach-call_true-valid-memsafety_true-no-overflow_false-termination.c
